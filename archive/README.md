# dataset_ufo/archive

### The archive folder contains: 

- **data that was used in the making of the final dataset**

   - _smaller, individual files that were later integrated either horizontally or vertically_
  

- **older versions of the final dataset** 
     - _When the dataset is updated in a later month, the previous dataset—excluding those months—will be moved here._
